# Using Reusable Workflows from the Phlex Repository

## Overview and General Instructions

The workflows in `Framework-R-D/phlex/` may be invoked as follows:

1. Automatically as part of CI checks on a PR submitted to `Framework-R-D/phlex`, at PR creation time and thereafter on pushes to the PR branch. This should work whether your PR branch is situated in the primary repository or a fork.
1. Via triggering comments on the PR (`@${{ github.event.repository.name }}bot <action>`).
1. Via the "actions" tab on the project's GitHub web page.

Additionally, you can configure your own fork of Phlex to run CI checks on local PRs, and on its default branch, following the instructions below.

If you are a Phlex-affiliated developer working on a dependent package of Phlex, or on a different Cetmodules-using package, or on Cetmodules itself, you may be able to invoke these workflows on your own project following the information in this guide. However, this is only supported for Phlex-affiliated developers, and even then on a best effort basis. We do **not** support or encourage others to utilize these workflows at this time.

### Running Workflows Manually (`workflow_dispatch`)

Most workflows in this repository can be run manually on any branch, tag, or commit. This is useful for testing changes without creating a pull request or for applying fixes to a specific branch.

To run a workflow manually:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab of the Phlex repository (or your fork).
1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to run (e.g., **Clang-Format Check**).
1. Above the list of workflow runs, you will see a banner that says "This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger." Click the **Run workflow** dropdown on the right.
1. Use the **Branch/tag** dropdown to select the branch you want to run the workflow on.
1. Some workflows have additional inputs (e.g., the `cmake-build` workflow allows you to specify build combinations). Fill these out as needed.
1. Click the **Run workflow** button.

### For Contributors Working on a Fork of Phlex

If you are developing on a fork of `Framework-R-D/phlex` itself, the CI/CD workflows will run automatically on your pull requests within the fork, just as they do on the main repository. You do not need to use the `uses:` syntax described below.

However, to enable the automatic fixing features (e.g., for `cmake-format-fix` or `python-fix` workflows), you will need to perform two steps:

1. **Enable Workflows:** By default, GitHub Actions are disabled on forks. You must manually enable them by going to the `Actions` tab of your forked repository and clicking the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" button.
1. **Create the `WORKFLOW_PAT` Secret:** The auto-fix workflows require a Personal Access Token (PAT) with write permissions to commit changes back to your PR branch. Follow the instructions below to create a PAT and add it as a secret named `WORKFLOW_PAT` **to your forked repository's settings**.

Once you have done this, you can trigger the auto-fix workflows by commenting on a pull request in your fork (e.g., `@${{ github.event.repository.name }}bot format`).

**Note on Authorization:** Comment-triggered workflows use authorization checks to ensure only trusted users can trigger potentially code-modifying operations. The workflows check that the comment author has one of the following associations: `OWNER`, `COLLABORATOR`, or `MEMBER`. This covers repository owners, explicitly invited collaborators, and organization members with any level of repository access. For a detailed analysis of the authorization model and security considerations, see [AUTHORIZATION_ANALYSIS.md](AUTHORIZATION_ANALYSIS.md).

### Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

For workflows that automatically commit fixes to pull requests (e.g., formatters), you must create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and add it as a secret to your repository.

1. **Create a PAT:** Follow the GitHub documentation to [create a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `WORKFLOW_FIXES_PAT`).
   - Grant it the following repository permissions:
      - `Contents`: `Read and write`
      - `Pull requests`: `Read and write`
2. **Add the PAT as a Repository Secret:**
   - In your repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Create a new repository secret named `WORKFLOW_PAT` and paste your PAT as the value.

### Calling a Reusable Workflow from a Different Repository

To use a workflow, you call it from a workflow file in your own repository's `.github/workflows/` directory. The basic syntax is:

```yaml
jobs:
  some_job:
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/<workflow_file_name>.yaml@<commit_sha>
    with:
      # ... inputs for the workflow ...
    secrets:
      WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}
```

You should follow the instructions in the previous section to create the `WORKFLOW_PAT` secret for your own repository.

**Note:** For stability and security, it is highly recommended to pin the workflow to a specific commit SHA rather than a branch like `@main`. Using a mutable branch means you will automatically receive updates, which could include breaking changes or, in a worst-case scenario, malicious code. Pinning to a commit SHA ensures you are using a fixed, reviewed version of the workflow.

For development purposes, you may choose to use `@main` at your own risk to get the latest changes.

#### Emulating Trigger Types and Relevance Checks

When calling a reusable workflow, it's often desirable to emulate the behavior of the calling workflow's trigger. For example, if your workflow is triggered by a manual `workflow_dispatch`, you likely want the reusable workflow to skip its relevance detection and check all files. Conversely, if triggered by a `pull_request`, you want detection enabled.

You can achieve this by passing the appropriate value to the `skip-relevance-check` input:

```yaml
    with:
      skip-relevance-check: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.event_name == 'issue_comment' }}
```

Additionally, to ensure the reusable workflow can access the correct code in an extra-repository context, always pass the `ref` and `repo`. The correct value depends on whether the workflow is a **check** (read-only) or **fix** (push-capable) workflow:

- **Check workflows** (e.g., `cmake-format-check.yaml`): a commit SHA is safe and precise.

  ```yaml
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}
        repo: ${{ github.repository }}
  ```

- **Fix workflows** (e.g., `cmake-format-fix.yaml`): a branch name is **required** because the
  workflow pushes commits with `git push origin HEAD:<ref>`. A commit SHA will cause the push to
  fail.

  ```yaml
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref || github.ref_name }}
        repo: ${{ github.repository }}
  ```

### 11. `codeql-analysis.yaml`

Performs static analysis on the codebase using GitHub CodeQL to identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding errors.

**Key Features:**

- **Automatic Relevance Detection**: On pull requests, the workflow automatically detects which languages have relevant file changes and only runs CodeQL analysis for those languages. This significantly reduces CI time when changes affect only a subset of languages.
- **Language-Specific Scanning**: Supports separate analysis for C++, Python, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Fallback to Full Scan**: Scheduled runs, manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`), and pushes to main branches always run all language scans regardless of changes.

#### Usage Example

```yaml
jobs:
  analyze:
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yaml@<commit_sha>
```

#### All Inputs

- `checkout-path` (string, optional): Path to check out code to.
- `build-path` (string, optional): Path for build artifacts.
- `language-matrix` (string, optional, default: `'["cpp", "python", "actions"]'`): JSON array of languages to analyze. When provided in `workflow_call`, bypasses automatic detection and forces analysis of specified languages.
- `pr-number` (string, optional): PR number if run in PR context.
- `pr-head-repo` (string, optional): The full name of the PR head repository.
- `pr-base-repo` (string, optional): The full name of the PR base repository.
- `pr-base-sha` (string, optional): Base SHA of the PR for relevance check.
- `pr-head-sha` (string, optional): Head SHA of the PR for relevance check.
- `ref` (string, optional): The branch, ref, or SHA to checkout.
- `repo` (string, optional): The repository to checkout from.

#### Behavior Notes

- **Pull Requests**: Only languages with relevant file changes are analyzed. For example, a PR that only modifies Python files will skip C++ and Actions analysis.
- **Manual Runs** (`workflow_dispatch`): All languages are analyzed regardless of changes.
- **Scheduled Runs**: All languages are analyzed regardless of changes.
- **Pushes to main/develop**: All languages are analyzed regardless of changes.
- **Language Override**: Providing the `language-matrix` input in `workflow_call` bypasses automatic detection.

### 15. `format-all.yaml`

Centralized workflow that calls all format fix workflows in parallel and posts a single combined PR comment with results.

**Trigger Methods:**

- `@phlexbot format` comment on a PR

**Behavior:**

- Invokes all fix workflows (clang-format, cmake-format, header-guards, jsonnet-format, markdown, python, yaml) via `workflow_call`
- Each sub-workflow runs with `skip-comment: "true"` to suppress individual comments
- Collects all results and posts a single summary comment
- Removes the 👀 reaction and adds a 🚀 reaction when complete

**Note:** This workflow is not designed to be called via `workflow_call` from other repositories. It is specifically for use within the Phlex repository.

### Other Workflows

The repository also provides `clang-tidy-check.yaml` and `clang-tidy-fix.yaml`. These workflows are currently **not** available for reuse via `workflow_call` as they are specifically intended for use on this repository and its forks.
